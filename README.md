## Cocomo Technical Assessment

This is a technical assessment as part of the [interview process](https://cocomo.ai/hiring) for Cocomo.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need a `FAL-KEY` API key to complete the technical assessment portion of the application. You will have received one alongside this application. Please message us on LinkedIn if you need one or sign up for a key at https://fal.ai  

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine.

## Development

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) app, with a SQLite based backend, intended to be run with the LTS version of Node.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Task:

Modify the code to add support for due dates and image previews.

### Part 1: Due Dates 

When a new task is created, users should be able to set a due date.

When showing the task list is shown, it must display the due date, and if the date is past the current time, the due date should be in red.

### Part 2: Image Generation 

When a todo is created, generate an image to visualize the task to be done. 

To do this, make a request to the [flux API on fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/dev/playground) and display the returned image to the user within the appropriate todo item. While the image is being generating, indicate a loading state.

You will be provided an API key to make the fetch request to fal.ai.
